and choose the following .jar-files from the SLICK_HOME folder:

*LWJGL.jar
*slick.jar
*jogg-0.0.7.jar
*jorbis-0.0.15.jar

2.Add these files in the Build Path by right-clicking the Javaproject folder, choose "Build Path",
then "Configure Build Path..." and finally "Add Jars".
They will now be found in an Referenced libraries folder as well.

3.Now to make it work on several platforms. 
Right-click the lib folder and choose to import archive file, navigate to SLICK_HOME folder and add each jar-file for the platforms (Windows,Mac and Linux).
NOTE! If you run a 64-bit OS you will need to download some extra files and do the same thing as above. 

4. Once you have imported all of the native libraries into your lib folder, you can associate this folder with lwjgl.jar.
If you are in the Java Perspective, then this jar will be located in the "Referenced Libraries" section.
Bring up the properties dialog for lwjgl.jar by right-clicking on it.
In the "Native library" page, select "Workspace..." and choose your project's lib folder.

5.If you want Javadoc added.To do this, navigate to your slick.jar in Referenced Libraries and edit its properties through the context menu.
One of the tabs allows you to specify the Javadoc Location. From here, point to the javadoc folder in SLICK_HOME. 
The Validate button will confirm that you have chosen the right location.

If you've done everything correct you can start play!
